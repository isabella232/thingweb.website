Differently from the Thingweb Hands-on, here we will show to use TypeScript along with node-wot as an npm dependency rather than cloning a GitHub repository. The aim is to establish an easy to understand and reusable template that can be used to implement any Exposed Thing.</description></item><item><title>Hands-on</title><link>http://thingweb.io/hands-on.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thingweb.io/hands-on.html</guid><description>Web of Things - hands-on This section aims to provide hands-on information about the Web of Things (WoT) in general and the technologies developed in this area.

In the world of Web of Thing properties, actions and events provided by a Thing are called Property Affordances, Action Affordances and Event Affordances, respectively. The difference of each becomes clear as we proceed the tutorial.</description></item><item><title>Testimonials</title><link>http://thingweb.io/_testimonials.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thingweb.io/_testimonials.html</guid><description> Testimonials In ullamcorper est eget tempor cursus neque mi consectetuer mi a ultricies massa est sed nisl Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra By Author City, Location In ullamcorper est eget tempor cursus neque mi consectetuer mi a ultricies massa est sed nisl Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra By Author City, Location In ullamcorper est eget tempor cursus neque mi consectetuer mi a ultricies massa est sed nisl Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra By Author City, Location</description></item><item><title>Videos</title><link>http://thingweb.io/videos.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://thingweb.io/videos.html</guid><description>Web of Things - Videos Short Introduction to Web of Things _

As a growing area, IoT services and application have a huge potential. From home automation to smart-grid passing by industrial manufacturers, IoT is gaining popularity as a potential solution to address their need. Several technologies can be used to build an IoT application mainly because of the specific constraints of the devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
